Open Cryptography Standard

### Disclaimer: This is **_NOT_** (currently?) for production use.

I don't claim myself to be a security expert which is why most of the algorithms chosen are well known standards in current certificate standards & infrastructures (specifically TLS 1.3 and NIST standards).

Why am I doing this? To understand X.509 certificates, cryptography and explore new types of PKI/WOT/Certificate infrastructures and sharing/verification mechanisms.
